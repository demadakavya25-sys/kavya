        <p>When Harald starts losing control over his body to Imu, he tells the guards to kill him, but his immortality
            prevents any damage. After Loki and Jarul show up, Harald tells Loki to take Elbaph's legendary Devil Fruit,
            kill him, and take over the throne. He soon loses control and attacks all of the guards, and stabs Jarul
            through his helmet, but Shanks and Gaban arrive and stop him from going after Loki. Loki finds the Devil
            Fruit but is suddenly attacked by Ragnir, which moves on its own.</p>
